Stay around an 8x8 base for every cell.

To export:
INFLATE
Sprite>Sprite Size
Set Width and Height to 400%. (This makes every cell 32x32, needs may change for larger sprites)


Add a 1Px border around every cell.
To do this
Sprite>Canvas Size
Add Num_Of_Cells_In_Row*2 to the width
Add Num_Of_Rows*2 to the height
(For example if we have a walking sprite sheet then it has 8 cells so the canvas size becomes 32*8x32*8 in the INFLATE step and then in this step
if becomes [32*8]+8*2x[32*8]+1*2 = 272x34px)

Setup the grid to be 34x34.
Use the marquee tool to center all sprites so they have a 1px border in their cell.
Press shift+O, click the square, set the color to black and click done.

Add whatever subpixel touches you need

Export just the first frame to a .png.
