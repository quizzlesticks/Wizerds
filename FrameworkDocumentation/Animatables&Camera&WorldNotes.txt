So the game manager (currently called WindowManager) should have knowledge
of the world space and the screenspace. Therefore, it should be our translational
unit.

The SSM should not have any knowledge of the world space, it only knows screen
space. Therefore, all calls to drawSprite should be in screen space.
The SSM also doesn't know anything about current animation states, it just knows
what each animation index should draw to the screen.

Everything that is or has an Animator is specifically in world space.

The camera position will be the players position. If we move the player position
we move both the players position in the CharacterController and we move the
cameras position in the WindowManager.

When we draw an animatable we make a call to the SSM but pass the world_space
position to the WindowManager to have it translated to screen space.

Positions passed to the SSM are taken as the position where we would like to
center our sprite

Every "pixel" or point on the game map corresponds to 128 pixels or points
in the world space. The WindowManager should also handle these translations.
